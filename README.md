#  Forecasting Flavours

Project Name: Weather Integrated Food Choices with SHAP Explanation

## Objective:
To empower cloud kitchen operations with adaptive and informed decision-making, reducing food wastage and aligning menu choices with dynamic weather patterns.


## Overview:
CulinaryWeather Insights is an innovative solution at the intersection of meteorology and gastronomy. In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud kitchens, this project addresses the challenges of predicting demand and reducing food wastage. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, the system predicts weather patterns and correlates them with historical sales data. The culmination of this effort is a comprehensive framework that not only forecasts demand with precision but also adapts swiftly to changing weather dynamics in real-time.

## The need:
To minimize the food wastages for the cloud kitchen using the state of art ML Techniques so that one can increase their business with growing technology.

## About:
The repository consists of three files which among them two are the datasets for the exploration of the weather prediction and the food recommendations and one of them consists of the implementation part of it.

The weather dataset was created using manual entry from website named wunderground.com which displays the daily weather of Bengaluru; a weather station setup by Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru whereas the food recommendation dataset was developed using the consumer behaviour and discussion thoroughly

The model proposed takes an user input from the user and then predicts the weather and then eventually lists the food categories list accordin to the weather where user can enter the food category and then he can get recommendations accordingly for it.
